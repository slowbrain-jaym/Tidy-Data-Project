Variables are named using the following convention:

1. Prefix:
  "t" for time domain varaibles
  "f" for frequency domain variables obtained from a FFT operation on the time 
      domain variable

2. Variables Name:
  Accelerometer data is processed into two seperate measurements:
  "BodyAcc" for acceleration of the body of the smart phone
  "GravityAcc" for the acceleration due to gravity
  
  "Gyroscope" gives position data from the smartphone's Gyroscope
  
3. Further Processing:
  Un processed varaibles are given by the convention above.
  "Jerk" indicates the variable has been differentiated w.r.t. time
  
4. Dimension:
  "X"/"Y"/"Z" indicates the direction of the variable
  "Mag" indicates the magnitude of the variable (euclidean norm of the xzy data)

5. Statistic:
  "mean()" mean of the variable of the experiment
  "std()" standard deviation of the variable over the experiment

so for example: tBodyAccJerkMag-mean() indicates the mean magnitude of the 
accelerometer reading in the time domain, differentiated w.r.t. time.
